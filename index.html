            <h2>Benefits of Cloud Management</h2>
            <li><b>Improved cost control</b>
                   Cloud resources and services cost money and can be deployed by almost any user with access to a cloud account. Management tracks and reports the resources and services being used, enabling businesses to gauge usage against cost. This can help prevent cloud waste and sprawl by identifying underutilized or obsolete cloud usage, which can be released for cost savings.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li><b>Consistent control</b>
                   Cloud management basically reflects the organization's best practices and priorities, which can be tracked and enforced in a consistent way. With this, the entire organization is held to the same consistent standards in cloud usage.</li>

            <li><b>Improved compliance and data protection</b>Cloud management almost universally implements strong authorization and authentication in the deployment of its resources and services. This can provide a meaningful platform for improved security, auditable data access, automated data backups and copies, and well-planned support for compliance requirements within the typical cloud shared responsibility model.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Better business insights</b>Cloud management reporting can help identify cloud usage by team, group, project or business division. This can help business leaders identify highest cloud usage against revenue or budget for better insights regarding how the cloud is actually being used -- and what that cloud use is bringing to the business.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="challenges"> <ul>
            <h2>Challenges of Cloud Automation</h2>   
            <li><b>Security management</b>
                   The major public cloud vendors continue to invest in their services and improve cloud security, such as their ability to fend off distributed denial-of-service attacks. Some experts say that today's cloud attacks are far less devastating than on-premises ones because cloud attacks are generally limited to a single misconfigured service, whereas a local attack might devastate an entire infrastructure.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cloud security challenges</b>
                   Cloud security breaches and incidents still occur, even as security technologies improve and service providers gird their networks. Malicious actors can attack network hosts and web apps as fast as they can be fortified. Cloud administrators should test their environments and review the latest security audits and reports. Take care when adopting new technologies, such as AI and machine learning, which use many diverse and distributed data sources and therefore broaden the range for potential attacks.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cost management</b>
                   Cloud computing costs can spiral if they are not managed from the start. Numerous short-term and long-term cost optimization strategies for cloud configurations can help keep budgets in line.</li>
